        I need an alterative to begcheese, can‚Äôt be good, too much salt, too much choloelstrol. You can make it up later in the day by having a salad, oatmeal. Fasting, which i have done. But it feels like a lotta sacrifice for something i lean on everyday. I smoked cigarettes for 13 years, i only quit because of i got sick of the taste of smoke. One day i couldn‚Äôt  do it anymore. Man that day is never gonna come with bacon egg and cheese lol . I tried turkey bacon, its alright, but the wh9ole point of learning to cook is to lower my processed food intake. I‚Äôm sure its a lot of processing to turn turkey into bacon. I used to follow Shannon Sharpe on IG. Every morning this man had a big bowl of oatmeal and like 6 eggs, and thats it. Every monring. I do love oatmeal. I do love eggs, but idk about that one.  Gotta put down the breakfast tacos, bacon egg and cheese bisquts, BEC Bagles, BEC Kolaches. BE&C has a grip on me.

        <p>I frequent thrift stores, I usually find great additions for my kitchen. I was watching a ton of Naruto while learning web development. Naruto is like Kobe, they make practice look sexy. And that's what you need when learning programming. It's not an end product, when you first start out, it's about a slow build. Putting in your first thousand hours into getting better. Naruto, is about ninjas with super powers, if you want more info you gotta look it up yourself. At the midpoint of the Naruto Shonen Jump series, Naruto levels up and can summon a GIANT toad to assist him in fighting. These animals exist in another realm. They have a contract whenever the owner calls on them they‚Äôll appear. Sometimes in the mood to fight, sometimes not so much.  Other characters have different animals. Itachi summons a gang of dogs. Other have a snake, a slug, and a monkey. Naturally I wanted to know what my animal would be. I think my thrifting habits answered that ofr me. I asked this question while I was cooking. In My dutch over, has a little metal piggy as the handle. I have a cast iron bacon press with a pig on it. My fav serving try is a pig with an apple in tis mouth. I was unintentionally surrounded by pigs in my kitsch, i‚Äôm on of those people. My friend's mom has ladybugs everywhere. That's her summoning Jutsu. What's yours? </p>

            <p>-shout out blue thread.  They are not a sponser, just a product I enjoy. Think tide pods but powder detergent.   It‚Äôs a tablet. No measuring cup. No awkward heavy container.  Containers that never get used again.  Congrats to you if you‚Äôre reusing them but majority of this containers are trash.  It‚Äôs the worse packaging. Blue thread mails you refills. Tablets come in a paper bag.  My closes smell fine.  They smell clean.  No strong fragrances.  I don‚Äôt want to smell like lavender to know my closes are clean.  </p>
                <p>-invest in some luffas.  I use bar soaps and luffas.  Less plastic containers.  Biodegradable materials.  Sustainable.  Cut the middle man out and grow. Luffas </p>
                <p>- bamboo cooking utensils. Plastic last too long.  Not biodegradable.  Bamboo is more sustainable.  Affordable. Less plastic ending up in your food.  -

                <p>  I love my cast iron.  When I found out Teflon releases chemicals when the pan is over heated. One look at my Teflon pans and that was a wrap.  They were scratched.  Burnt.  The Teflon itself was coming off. I didn‚Äôt know how much chemicals I ingest daily because of my cookware.  Cast iron seemed like an obvious choice.  It‚Äôs even a good source of iron.  Even if I mess up and everything sticks to the pan. It‚Äôs whatever.  If it takes extra time to clean it‚Äôs no biggie.  I like to have them cleaned and greased up ready for the next round.  I leave my cast iron on the stove.  Permanent. residence.  They get better with age.  I don‚Äôt season my pans periodically. The pan smooths out over time even if you don‚Äôt have seasoning on the pan.  Salt and napkins budget has increased.  Clean it with hot water. Boil some water in it if the food is stuck on.  Or a salt scrub.  You got time.  Don‚Äôt pretend your life is so busy you don‚Äôt have 7 minutes.
